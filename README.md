# PDF to IMG Converter
This is a simple automation script that converts pdf into images when a file is drop in the folder "DROP PDF". You can add files even when it is running.

## Why I made it?
I was lazy to go in websites and convert it. Plus some websites has limited convertion. Mine is instant and it auto-converts when drop immediately. Plus it can be run in the background.

## How to use it?
Open the folder pdf_2_img_converter

First run this piece of code:

    python3 pip install -r requirements.py
then:

    python3 pdf_to_img.py

## How to contact me?
